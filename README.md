# GamedevBot

Its a bot

for gamedev

and shit

Some of the current commands includes; !g for googling quires; !LoA for the legend of ash; !cb to put pre written code into code blocks; as well as other commands that is useful and convinent.

After pulling, create a copy of the `.env.template` and name it `.env` (This is proper etiquette to ensure the token is never in the repo)
In the `.env`, paste the token given in the #TOKEN channel on discord

It's also etiquette to not include `node_modules`, so I'll **remove** it from the repo and and gitignore it.
**NOTE**: This means you should run `npm i` in the root after pulling, every time.
