# GamedevBot

Its a bot

for gamedev

and shit

After pulling, create a copy of the `.env.template` and name it `.env` (This is proper etiquette to ensure the token is never in the repo)
In the `.env`, paste the token given in the #TOKEN channel on discord

Its also etiquette to never include `node_modules`, but whatever.
